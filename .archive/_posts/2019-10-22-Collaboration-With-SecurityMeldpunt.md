We are not the only ones who want to make the online work safer by doing vulnerability reporting. Frank Breedijk, also known of his vulnerability scanner Seccubus, was already working on a ["Security Meldpunt"](https://www.securitymeldpunt.nl/english/), or hotline, for vulnerability reporting in the Netherlands. He is currently setting up a response team among network operators. We are happy to join forces and get this working. Like us, the hotline is in the build up phase so don't file reports yet.
