We are a network of security researchers who mainly work online. In the future, we may develop a contact point for receiving vulnerability reports, but for the moment, we already have enough of our own. If you want to contact us for any other matters, you can send us an e mail. We have the catch-all function enabled, so you can just use any word and add @divd.nl. Most likely, our chairman Victor will answer, or forward your mail to Chris or Astrid.

If you want to join our team as researcher, or help out in any other way you are welcome. We have a team meeting every month at various places in the Netherlands. You can also meet us at cyber security conferences and hacker events.
